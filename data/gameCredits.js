const GameCredits= `In the realm of X's and O's, Upon the grid they go
Where two contenders face off, in tic-tac-toe.
A pencil mark, a battle stark, lines cross like ancient runes.
Each player seeks, with tactic sleek, to align their three and twos.

First goes X, with hopes to vex, in the corner she resides,
Then O's response, a parry, a taunt, beside the X she hides.
The square becomes a battleground, where silent warriors clash,
With every mark, they leave their spark, in this timeless match.

A diagonal attempt, an intercept, the X's make their claim,
But O is shrewd, not easily subdued, and blocks the path to fame.
They dance in turns, the board it churns with symbols old as time,
A line unbroken, a token, a victory sublime.

The tension mounts, the stakes are high, each move a calculated choice,
As X and O, in endless flow, make their presence voice.
The game unfolds, a tale untold, a strategic dance of wit,
Where only one shall claim the throne, the other must submit.

The final move, a bold reprove, the triumph now in sight,
One player reigns, the other wanes, in this cerebral fight.
Tic-tac-toe, a timeless show, where minds and skills entwine,
A classic game, a lasting fame, a victory divine.`
